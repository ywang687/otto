Otto classification challenge from Kaggle

The first r script, productclassifcation uses very basic random forest and obtained a score of 0.64283 (mediocre, about top 45%)

The second, productclassifiationXGB, was a preliminary attempt at using XGBoost to get a better score. Due to likely formatting 
issues, it obtained a score of 2.73918 (very bad, bottom 20%)

The third, productclassificationXGB2, was an attempt at using XGBoost for classification and got my best score of 0.48729 
(decent, about top 30% of kagglers in the competition)
